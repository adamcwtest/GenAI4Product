These code samples are experiments in me eating my own cake at AWS. As we deliver new capapabilities in Generative AI, I run an experiment applying those features to how my team analyzes and selects features for financial services customers to continue on their cloud journey. If you want to build a lean canvas, a product strategy canvas, a value proposition canvas, or a customer advisory council that pulls from a knowledge base of your data, the code samples are all here for you to begin.
